# New Years Review Exercise
Happy New Year! We are going to review some concepts that we have learned thus far by creating a New Years Resolution app.

Do your best to complete what you can in the time allotted, no pressure if you're not able to finish it all!

Create an HTML page that includes:
1. A form for you to enter in a resolution, as well as a number representing it's priority (higher means more important).
2. A list (`<ul>`) of your new years resolutions.

Create JavaScript that upon submission of the form, it adds the resolution to the list of resolutions, and clears the form.

With any remaining time, explore:
- adding more fields to the form
- adding an ability to mark the resoltion as "done"
- remove the resolutions
- add styles
