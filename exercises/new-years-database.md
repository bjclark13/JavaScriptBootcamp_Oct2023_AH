Create a database table to hold your New Years Resolutions.

This should include:
    - id (serial primary key)
    - goal (string)
    - priority (number)
    - deadline (datetime)
    - complete (boolean)
and any other values you think are necessary.

Add at least 5 different sample resolutions using INSERT statements.

Write queries to:
- Get all of the resolutions, but only the goal field.
- Get all of the completed resolutions.
- Get all of the resolutions sorted by priority.
- Get the resolution with the closest deadline.
- Delete 1 resolution from the table
